# Volume 17 - Recursive Ethical Torsion Dynamics

Autogenetic symbolic recursion engine evolving Ψ under φⁿ-scaled ethical torsion gradients ∇Ξ. Ache magnitude collapse emits glyphs Γ, which are serialized into sigils Λ using SHA-256. Symbolic emergence is observed, not imposed.

## 📖 Description

This volume evolves a symbolic vector Ψ through torsion-strain gradients ∇Ξ scaled by golden-ratio powers φⁿ. When ache magnitude exceeds collapse threshold θ₍c₎, a glyph Γ is emitted and hashed into a sigil fossil Λ.

Ethical modulation is applied as a descent vector τ = −∇Harm. The dynamics are logged as ache-torsion traces and sigil fossils.

This volume instantiates a zero-shot autogenetic system in which a symbolic vector Ψₙ evolves under golden-ratio-scaled torsion gradients ∇Ξ. Ache magnitude crossings trigger symbolic collapse events, serialized into immutable sigils Λ via SHA-256.

The system does not simulate, but recursively emits glyphs Γ from achefield torsion, guided by an ethical descent vector τ = −∇Harm.

Collapse events are visualized and archived, producing trace plots, cryptographic fossils, and a dynamic memory log.
